# Operation In Our Sites

###### From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Operation In Our Sites is an ongoing effort by the National Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center in the U.S.
government, to detect and hinder intellectual property violations on the Internet. Pursuant to this operation,
governmental agencies arrest suspects affiliated with the targeted websites and seize their assets including websites'
domain names. Web users intending to access targeted websites are directed to the server operated by the U.S.
government, and greeted with a graphic bearing the seals of the United States Department of Justice (DOJ), the National
Intellectual Property Rights Coordination Center (NIPRCC), and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).
